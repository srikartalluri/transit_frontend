Hello Everyone This is the frontend for the Bart Transit Project, a simplified version of the Transit App.

I made this to learn how to create an entire small scale web app. It has the ability to show train departure times for any of the BART train stations and all lines. It allows you to filter results based on what line or what station you care about.

The backend essentially collects info from the Bart Area Rapid Transit (BART) train system API and sends it to the front end, which is then displayed on the website. 

The frontend is made in React and the backend is made with Django. Ensure that the backend server is running and then we can host the frontend domain with the following command:
npm start
